				<h3>Vicar's Message</h3>
				<img src="./media/Achen.jpg" style="float: left" class="contentPic" width="350" height="375">
				<p style="color: #8F181C">"Jesus answered (to Thomas), I am the Way and the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through me." St. John 14:6</p>
				<p>Welcome to our Church Website. As the Vicar of the St. Thomas Indian Orthodox Church of Baltimore, it is my pleasure and privilege to welcome everyone to our website. Please have a tour with the various links and informative pages. Our church is a part of the Malankara (Indian) Orthodox Church, which has the great heritage and tradition based on the Holy Bible and the Church Fathers. The Church was founded in India on 52 A.D, by St. Thomas, one of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ. The hierarchical head of the Orthodox Church in India is His Holiness Baselius Marthoma Paulose II. His Holiness is known as the Catholicos, which means the Universal Father. The Church has dioceses in India and abroad.</p>
				<p>The history of St. Thomas Orthodox Church of Baltimore goes back to 1960's when a few Malayalee families, without denominational differences, met together for occasional prayer meetings. By considerable progress through years of blessings, a new church building was constructed and dedicated in May 12, 2001. Thus, the cherished dream of the faithful members of this parish became a reality. We praise the Holy name of God and His Son Jesus Christ, the guidance of the Holy Spirit and the great intercession of our patron Saint Thomas, for this gift given for the blessings of this community. The Church provides opportunities for believers to come together for worship and fellowship. We have regular prayer meetings, occasional family get-togethers, Bible Study groups, Sunday School, MGOCSM (Mar Gregorios Orthodox Christian Student Movement), OVBS (Orthodox Vacation Bible School) and Martha Mariam Samajam (Women’s Meeting), which provide spiritual growth to the members. We also participate in the Ecumenical Council of Kerala Christian Churches in Baltimore-Washington, and its clergy fellowship.</p>
				<p>Our Church, through this Website, endeavors to give access to the public, the details about the activities of this Church. We hope this will help our visitors to grow up spiritually by the abundance of God’s Grace. As the Vicar, I have great pleasure to greet and welcome you all who visit our Website and join us for Orthodox Christian worship and doctrinal values.</p>

				<h3>About Our Church</h3>
				<p style="color: #8F181C; text-indent: 0px"><b>Church History</b></p>
				<p>Malankara Orthodox Church is an ancient Church of India and it traces its origin to as far back as A. D. 52 when St. Thomas one of the Disciples of Jesus Christ came to India and established Christianity in the South Western parts of the sub-continent. The St. Thomas Christians or the Syrian Christians exist at present in different churches and denominations. But a major section of the parent body of St. Thomas Christians which has maintained its independent nature constitutes the Orthodox Church under the Catholicate of the East with Headquarters at Devalokam in Kottayam, Kerala.</p>

					<p style="color: #8F181C; text-indent: 0px"><b>The Beginning of the Church</b></p>
					<p>St. Thomas, one of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ, is the founder of the ancient church in India. Christian writers and historians from the 4th century refer to the evangelistic work of Apostle Thomas in India, and the Indian Christians ascribe the origin of their church to the labours of the apostle in the first century. It is reasonable to believe that the St. Thomas came to India, preached the gospel, established the church and died there as a martyr. It is believed that St. Thomas arrived in Cranganore, Kerala, India, in 52 A.D. He preached the gospel and founded seven and a half churches; Kodungallore, Paayoor, Kottakavu (near North Paravur), Kokkamangalam, Niranam, Nilakkal or Chayal, Kollam and Thiruvithamkode, and appointed prelates and priests. He is believed to have been martyred at Mylapur, Madras (now Chennai), India, around 72 A.D. Malankara Orthodox Church in India is as old as any ancient Christian communities elsewhere in the world.</p>
					<p style="color: #8F181C; text-indent: 0px"><b>The Persian Connection</b></p>
					<p>The Indian Church came in contact with the East Syrian Church possibly from the 4th century. In the 5th century, the church of Persia came to its own. The Catholicos with his seat at Seleucia -Ctesiphon began to be called also Patriarch and in 486 A. D. the Church officially accepted a resolution in its Synod to recognize Nestorius as a Saint and Church Father. This decision was not however accepted by a minority of Persian Christians who acknowledged a Catholicos at Tagrit in northern Mesopotamia as their spiritual head in 629 A. D. There is evdence that in the 8th century the Indian Church had its Primate known as "The Metropolitan and the Gate of All India" a title adopted presumably under Islamic influence. The Vatican Codex 22, written in Cranganore in 1301 gives the titles as "The Metropolitan of the Throne of St. Thomas and of the whole Church of the Christians in India." The Indian Church maintained its autonomous administration. The Church of Persia had a tradition which acknowledged autonomy of Churches in its communion abroad. The Church in Kerala continued as an administratively independent community till the 16th century.</p>
					<p style="color: #8F181C; text-indent: 0px"><b>The Portugese Period</b></p>
					<p>Things changed during the Portuguese period. The missionaries who came from abroad were eager to bring the Indian Church into communion with Rome. They worked on it almost through the 16th century. In 1599 by the Synod of Diamper, the assembly of representatives from churches was forced to give up the Indian Church's connection with the Patriarch of the Persian Church in favour of the Pope of Rome. But there was dissatisfaction among the people. This dissatisfaction led to a general revolt in 1653 known commonly as the Coonan Cross revolt. Portuguese efforts to put it down by force did not succeed. Now Rome entered the field directly through Missionaries, and a section of those who rebelled went back to Roman allegiance. A body of the people led by the Archdeacon, who stood for the administrative autonomy of the Indian Church inspite of serious difficulties, was determined to keep to the independence of the Indian Church. The Portuguese were in fact instrumental in causing a division in the one united church in India. Although they succeeded in getting the allegiance of a party in the Church to the Roman Catholic community, an equally important party did not follow their way.</p>
					<p style="color: #8F181C; text-indent: 0px"><b>The Antiochene Connection</b></p>
					<p>The party, that sought to preserve the Church's freedom, appealed to several Eastern Christian Centres for help in restoring its Episcopal succession. The Antiochene Syrian Patriarch responded and decided to send a Bishop to India and thus Metropolitan Mar Gregorios of Jerusalem came to India in 1665. The Archdeacon who had been declared in the meantime to be Metropolitan Mar Thoma was now confirmed by him in his Episcopal rank by the laying of hands by twelve Presbyters and both of them worked together to organize the church on firm footing. Mar Thoma I was followed in succession by a series of Prelates with the same name till 1816 when the last of them namely Mar Thoma IX came to the scene, but was soon replaced by Mar Dionysius II. Malankara Orthodox Church had felt the need of assistance for establishing systematic education for its clergy, teaching the people in the faith, instructing the clergy in properly celebrating the liturgical services and above all assistance in the maintenance of the Episcopal succession intact. But the Orthodox Church maintained its autonomous administration and life under local leadership. Even the help from the Antiochene Syrian Patriarch was without any idea of formally submitting to his jurisdiction, but only for an overall spiritual supervision and of keeping to a friendly relation. There were differences of opinion over the authority of the Patriarch in the Malankara Church and it created certain difficulties. But the Church has always been successful in maintaining its freedom and never allowed any foreign domination.</p>
					<p style="color: #8F181C; text-indent: 0px"><b>Co-operation with the C.M.S.</b></p>
					<p>By 1795 the British established themselves in South India and Kerala came under their sway. During the time of Col. Munroe who was the British Resident in Kerala, Pulikottil lttoop Ramban expressed his interest in founding a seminary for the teaching of the Church's Clergy. The Resident supported him and they helped the church to start theological seminary at Kottayam in 1815. Pulikottil lttoop Ramban became a Bishop -Metropolitan Mar Dionysius II. From 1816 the experiment of co-operation between the Malankara Church and the Church Mission Society (C. M. S.) of the Anglican Church was carried on, but it was found to be unsuccessful and was called off in 1836. This eventually gave rise to the division of the community into three bodies. One of them tried to bring about serious reforms in the liturgy and practices of the Church, but failed. After about half a century of conflict within the Church, this body had to withdraw and organize itself as the Mar Thoma Church. A smaller body of the Syrian Christians opted to join with the missionaries and be absorbed in the Anglican Church. The majority of the community continued in the Church without accepting the reforms.</p>
					<p style="color: #8F181C; text-indent: 0px"><b>Authority of the Patriarch of Antioch</b></p>
					<p>The conflict between the body which adopted the reform and that which opposed it was a serious development in the church during the 19th century. This led to the latter to appeal for help from the Antiochene Syrian Patriarch. In 1875 Patriarch Peter III came to Kerala and held a Synod of representatives of Churches at Mulanthuruthy in 1876. This Synod adopted a number of resolutions including an admission that the Church would continue in the communion of the Patriarch and the Syrian Church of Antioch. However the Patriach tried to see in these decisions more than the Indian Church really wanted to acknowledge. Following the Synod of Mulanthuruthy in 1876, litigation in court between the party in favour of the reforms and the party against it continued. It came to an end in 1889 with the judgement announced in favour of the latter by the then highest court of Kerala, the Royal Court of Appeal. The majority in a panel of three judges gave their verdict admitting that from the middle of the 18th century an over- all spiritual supervision used to be exercised by the Patriarch over the Malankara Church and that he had a right to claim it. Patriarch Peter was not satisfied with this judgement. He was keen to establish that he had full authority over the Malankara Church both in its spiritual and in its temporal matters and not merely an overall spiritual supervision. In fact he protested though nobody responsible in the matter took note of it. His second successor Patriarch Mar Abdullah II was determined to follow up the matter. With this intention he came to Kerala in 1909 and pressed the issue. But that led to a sad division in the Church from 1911, one party siding with the Patriarch and the other lining up with Metropolitan Mar Dionysius VI of Vattasseril who stood against him and wanted to keep up the independence of Malankara Church.</p>
					<p style="color: #8F181C; text-indent: 0px"><b>Catholicate Established in Malankara in 1912</b></p>
					<p>In this conflict the Metropolitan could obtain the support of Patriarch Mar Abdul Messiah the immediate successor to Patriarch Peter III. Patriarch Peter III was succeeded in 1895 by Mar Abdul Messiah. By a state interference he had lost his position in Turkey and came to be replaced by Mar Abdulla. While Metropolitan Mar Dionysius VI negotiated with the Canonical senior Patriarch Abdul Messiah who offered to assist the former. Thus in 1912, with the support of the Patriarch, who was senior to Mar Abdulla, the Catholicate of the East in Malankara was restored in India. Thereby the Patriarch himself has withdrawn his right of spiritual oversight if any of the Indian Church, which the Royal Court of Appeal had acknowledged for him in 1889. The ceremony was held at St. Mary's Church Niranam on 15 September 1912 to establish The Catholicate of the East in Malankara; Niranam Church is one of the Churches founded by St. Thomas during his visit here in the first century. The designation "Catholicos of the East" to the successors of St. Thomas the Apostle was given by the Jerusalem Synod of AD 231. The headquarters of the Orthodox Church of the East were first at Uraha (Edessa) in Persia. This was moved to 'Selucia' and it was there the title "Catholicos of the East" originated. Catholicos is an ecclesiastical dignitary recognised in the Antiochen Syrian Church also. He is equal in rank with the Patriarch though the latter is considered as first among equals (primus interparees).</p>
					<p style="color: #8F181C; text-indent: 0px"><b>Constitution of the Church Adopted in 1934</b></p>
					<p>Malankara Orthodox Church is now administered as per the constitution adopted in 1934 which was passed by the Malankara Syrian Christian Association. The Association is a fully representative body of the church with elected members -priests and laymen -from all the Parish Churches. Now one priest each and laymen 1 to 10 depending on the number of members in each parish are members of the Association. There are about 1400 parishes under the Malankara Orthodox Church. It is the Association which elects the Catholicos and the Malankara Metropolitan and also the Bishops. There is a Managing Committee for the Association with members from each Diocese elected by the Association. The Malankara Metropolitan is the President of the Managing Committee and the remaining Prelates having administrative charge are the Vice-Presidents. The Association Managing Committee has a Working Committee with Malankara Metropolitan as the President. The Working Committee is also the Consultative Committee of the Malankara Metropolitan. The Episcopal Synod has all the Prelates of the Malankara Church as members. Matters concerning Faith, Order and Discipline are under the authority of the Episcopal Synod. It is the Episcopal Synod which installs the Catholicos.</p>
					<p style="color: #8F181C; text-indent: 0px"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
					<p>The Indian Church has an apostolic foundation. Now with the establishment of the Catholicate in 1912 the Orthodox Church has come to its own. Although majority of the members of the church numbering about 2.5 million live in Kerala, they could be found now spread over not only in all the different states of India, but also in all the continents throughout the world. There are a total of 25 Dioceses now, 16 of them in Kerala and 9 of them outside Kerala. Orthodox Church is an ancient, autonomous, independent Indian Church with headquarters at Catholicate Aramana, Devalokam, Kottayam, Kerala has His Holiness The Catholicos of the East and Malankara Metropolitan as the Supreme Head.</p>

				<p style="color: #8F181C; text-indent: 0px"><b>Our Faith and Belief</b></p>
				<p>The Nicene Creed is the creed or profession of faith that is most widely used in our Christian liturgy. It is called Nicene because, in its original form, it was adopted in the city of Nicaea by the first ecumenical council, which met there in 325 and at that time, the text ended after the words "We believe in the Holy Spirit". The second Ecumenical Council in 381 added the section that follows the words "We believe in the Holy Spirit" hence the name "Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed", referring to the Creed as modified in Constantinople.</p>

				<p>Feasts and Fasts plays a very important role in renewing our spiritual lives.The Bible says the prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective, yet something extraordinary happens when two or more agree together in prayer. Feasts and fasts are arranged by our church fathers so that we can resubmit ourselves before our Lord and be a blessing to people around us.

				<p>Sunday School is a spiritual organization functioning in all the parishes of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church throughout the world. It takes care of the spiritual nurturing of the children, by bringing them up in the knowledge and fellowship of Jesus Christ and His Church. The classes range from Pre-K to 12th grade.</p>

					<p class="pHeaders">"Let the children come to me; do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God." St. Mathew 19:14</p>
					<p>Sunday School constitutes an integral part of our church. As the primary mission we provide the seed of spiritual knowledge to be planted in our children as they grow through the Sunday School and its programs. Our youngsters are taught the Orthodox Christian faith and traditions so that they practice them in their life, develop a closer relationship with God, and pass it along to the future generations. Based on the Indian Orthodox Church curriculum, the Sunday School program is structured to provide children a basic understanding of the Holy Bible, faith, beliefs and the history of the Indian Orthodox Church. In addition, the children are also exposed to the hymns of the Holy Qurbana and important prayers used in our daily worship.</p>
					<p>Our Sunday School year runs from September through May, and classes convene every Sunday immediately after the Holy Qurbana. Currently, there are more than 45 students enrolled in the Sunday school program, divided into seven classes based on age. Furthermore, the Sunday school conducts other annual activities such as the Sunday School Anniversary, Summer Reading Program, and Second Round. We also actively participate in national and local events such as Orthodox Vacation Bible School (OVBS), and regional Sunday school competitions conducted by the American Diocese and Ecumenical Kerala Christian Council (ECKC) programs.</p>

					<p class="pHeaders">"Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised." Proverbs 31:30</p>
					<p>Martha Mariam Samajam is the ladies wing in the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church. The Martha Mariam Samajam, meant for the women of the Orthodox Church, was started in 1928 (1104 Edavam 15). K. M. Annamma of Kandathil family was the Secretary during its early years.</p>
					<p>The Martha Mariam Samajam functions with the three objectives: "Pray, Illumine and Act.” Camps, seminars and study classes are being organized for the spiritual, educational and social progress and development of women. In 1964, the constitution of the organization was recognized by the Holy Episcopal Synod. The head office is the 'Vanithasamajam Mandiram' in Kanjikuzhi, Kottayam. About one-lakh of women are members of the Martha Mariam Samajam.</p>
					<p>This is an organization of the women in the diocese, and all women in the Malankara Orthodox Church are members. Presently more than three thousand women are participating in the organization. Its headquarters is at Kottayam, Kerala, India, and presently, the Diocesan Center serves as the Samajam office in America.</p>
					<p>The motto of this organization is “Pray, Act, and Shine,” with St. Mary as the Patron Saint. The Diocesan Bishop serves as the President of this organization, and appoints the Vice-President. All other office bearers and committee members are elected at the annual conference.</p>
					<p>Our church Martha Mariam Samajam is one of the most active groups in the Diocese. Several members attend the annual conferences and retreats, and support the charity works led by the Church. The St. Mary’s Association of our church is the backbone of the successful running of our Holy Week and Perunals. Their prayers, fasting and selfless dedication has been one of the greatest blessings to the parish. The Martha Mariam Samajam meets twice a month and more if guests visit the parish. In their gatherings, the Holy Bible is read, songs, and devotional message given, followed by any business matters and closing prayers.</p>
